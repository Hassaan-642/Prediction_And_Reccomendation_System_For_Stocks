# Prediction_And_Reccomendation_System_For_Stocks
I developed an advanced Stock Market Prediction and Recommendation System utilizing robust technical indicators to analyze stock performance and predict future trends using K means Clustering with Regression. This project employs sophisticated metrics such as Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), providing in-depth insights into market behavior and guiding strategic investment decisions.

Key Features:

Moving Averages (SMA): Evaluates short-term and long-term trends; identifies bullish trends when the 50-day SMA exceeds the 200-day SMA.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures momentum and indicates overbought or oversold conditions, essential for timing trades.
MACD: Analyzes trend strength and momentum; predicts market direction based on signal and histogram analysis.
  
                                                                                                                                                                 
The system generates clear recommendations backed by data-driven insights, enhancing decision-making processes for investors. Visual representations, including trend arrows and graphical charts, intuitively illustrate market forecasts and technical analysis findings.
